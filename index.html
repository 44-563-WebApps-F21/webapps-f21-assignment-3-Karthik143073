        <h6>GOA</h6>
        <p>Goa is popularly known as the Pearl of the <b>orient</b> and tourist <b>paradise</b>. It is located in India's coastal belt on the western called the Konkan coast. It has an alarming scenic beauty. The architectural work done Goan Temples, Churches and old houses has brought great laurels to Goa. I like goa because of beaches.</p>

        <blockquote cite="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-hashing-using-polynomial-rolling-hash-function/">String hashing is the way to convert a string into an integer known as a hash of that string.
            An ideal hashing is the one in which there are minimum chances of collision (i.e 2 different strings having the same hash).For more info <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-hashing-using-polynomial-rolling-hash-function/">click here</a>
